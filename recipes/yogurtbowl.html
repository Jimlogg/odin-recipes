        <p>It is time to do this thing. I don't think you are <strong><em>even ready</em></strong> for the amount of carbs in this dish</p>

        <h1>Ingredientes</h1>
        <ul><li>950 grams of Fage yogurt</li>
        <li>4 cups of whole grain, rolled oats</li>
        <li>Organic pasta de mani, sin azucar</li>
        <li>Chia seeds, flax seeds, cocoa nibs, hemp seeds, and pumpkin seeds</li>
        <li>Blueberries, one banana, and blackberries</li>
        <li>Coconut oil (1 table spoon)</li>
        </ul>
       <h2>Instruciones</h2>
        <ol><li>4 cups of water, preferably high quality water. If it ain't, that's fine, hopefully the bad shit will get filtered out during the boiling</li>
<li>Bring the water to a boil in a big pot with a sprinkle of Himalayan Pink Sea Salt if you're boujee. Add oats, reduce the heat to low, and cap with a lid. </li>
<li>Stir often and keep an eye on them. The starch forms a foam that cannot be stopped once it rises, so you may have to alternate the heat or bat it down with a spoon. <strong><em>Seriously, otherwise, your stovetop will get destroyed and the hardened starch is a bear to remove</em></strong></li>
        <li>While the oatmeal does its thing, get the rest of your ingredientes out and locked and loaded</li>
        <li>Add 300-400 grams of yogurt to a large bowl, or half of the container. Add three tablespoons of mani de pasta, and the remainder of the ingredientes, <strong>EXCEPT</strong> the coconut oil.</li>
<li>Add oatmeal to the bowl when it's ready, straining out all of the water. Add a table spoon of coconut oil to the hot oatmeal on top, before thoroughly mixing the bowl for roughly one minutes</li>
    <li>Garnish with cinnamon and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>You better be hungry. Definitely add enough chia seeds to balance out the carb load. It can be a lot if it's your first time</p>
